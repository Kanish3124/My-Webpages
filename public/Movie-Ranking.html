<h1>Movie reviews and ratings by Film Critic Kanish</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Leo</h3>
<p>"
Leo" is a cinematic gem that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. This thrilling masterpiece combines a gripping storyline, stellar performances, and impeccable direction, making it a must-watch for both movie enthusiasts and casual viewers alike.<br />

The plot is a rollercoaster of emotions and intrigue. Set against the backdrop of World War II, it follows the journey of a brilliant but enigmatic codebreaker, played masterfully by VIJAY, as he attempts to crack an unbreakable enemy code. The film beautifully weaves historical accuracy with the suspense of an espionage thriller, creating a rich and immersive narrative that leaves you guessing at every turn.<br />
    
The cast delivers outstanding performances, with VIJAY giving an Oscar-worthy portrayal of a tormented genius, and TRISHA providing a standout performance in a complex supporting role. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to the characters' relationships.<br />

<h3>Vikram</h3>
<p>
Vikram review : Kamal Hassan is Back with a Bang.<br /> 
My rating : 3.5/5<br /> 
Performances : <br /> 
If you are a Kamal fan, this film is a feast for you. If you are a fan of some good performances, again Vikram is for you too. So whatever category you belong to, Vikram satisfies you for sure because of the master of acting, Kamal Haasan. Kamal gave an unbelievable performance throughout the film, particularly in the action scenes. His expressions are priceless. The first half of the film has very little screen presence of Kamal, but he is always there with his character. And when you get into second half, Kamal will grab all your attention towards him with spell bounding performance.<br /> 
Fahadh Faasil stole the show and he is seen throughout the first half. He carried the film on his shoulders with his intense and expressive performance. Without thundering powerful dialogues and doing breathtaking stunts, he made a powerful impact. Vijay Sethupathi got a tailor-made role and he slipped into the role of a menacing drug lord quite effortlessly. But for all his performance, he ended up annoying viewers as monotony crept into his role.

<h3>Kaithi</h3>
<p>
 The Film is superb, awesome, excellent etc;. Simple plot but extraordinary screen play makes the movie a great one <br />
Karthi acting Vera level the character has suited him very well and he done complete justice to that. Without karthi it's tough to imagine with any other hero. Also we need to appreciate karthi on accepting this role as he is introduced in screen almost after first 10-15 of the film and also there were too many people sharing the screen space. Great Karthi sir!!!
 Next impressive character is the police constable role played by George Maryan. Acting too good. Role is also good as a honest police. <br />
Dheena playing as the Lorry owner boy has done well.
Narain also done his part neatly.
All others college students,
villains have done neatly.
The small girl playing karthi's daughter also has acted well<br />
